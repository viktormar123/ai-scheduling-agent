Dear Scheduling Assistant,

We are requesting assistance in creating a shift schedule for the front desk reception team at Northwood Medical Center.

Operational hours: 24/7.
Shifts:
	•	Morning: 6:00 a.m. – 2:00 p.m.
	•	Afternoon: 2:00 p.m. – 10:00 p.m.
	•	Night: 10:00 p.m. – 6:00 a.m.

Team members (14 employees):
	•	Emily J. (full-time, reception, 5 years, prefers mornings)
	•	Michael S. (full-time, reception, 3 years, can cover any shift)
	•	Sarah W. (part-time 50%, reception, student – unavailable weekdays mornings)
	•	David R. (full-time, security desk, night shift specialist)
	•	Anna T. (full-time, reception, 2 years, backup security)
	•	John B. (full-time, reception, 6 years)
	•	Jessica L. (full-time, admin tasks, backup reception)
	•	Daniel F. (full-time, reception)
	•	Laura M. (part-time 75%, reception, can work evenings and weekends only)
	•	Robert D. (full-time, reception, 1 year, needs supervision on nights)
	•	Chloe P. (part-time 50%, student, weekends only)
	•	Samuel K. (full-time, reception)
	•	Sophia A. (full-time, reception)
	•	William C. (full-time, security desk, 4 years, prefers nights)

Special conditions:
	•	At least 2 receptionists must be on duty per shift.
	•	At least 1 employee with >3 years experience should be present on each morning and afternoon shift.
	•	Night shifts must always have either David R. or William C. as part of the team.
	•	Students (Sarah W., Chloe P.) cannot work weekday mornings.
	•	Laura M. only works afternoons and weekends.

We are aiming for fairness in distributing weekend shifts and minimizing consecutive night shifts for non-specialized staff.

Thank you.
