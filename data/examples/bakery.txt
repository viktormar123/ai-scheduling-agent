Hi!

We need a schedule for our bakery shop, “Sunny Bakes.” We’re open 7 a.m. to 6 p.m. Monday to Saturday.

We have 6 people:
	•	Tom
	•	Lucy (only mornings)
	•	Mark (full-time)
	•	Zoe (part-time, helps cleaning too)
	•	Peter (baker)
	•	Mia (student, afternoons only)

Usually people work 6–8 hour shifts.

Peter always has to be there at least in the morning.

Thanks!!
