Hello! We are a small store called “Trendz Clothing” looking to organize employee shifts.

Our store hours are:
	•	Monday–Saturday: 10:00 a.m. – 8:00 p.m.
	•	Sunday: 12:00 p.m. – 6:00 p.m.

We usually have two shifts on weekdays and one shift on Sundays:
	•	Morning: 10:00 a.m. – 3:00 p.m.
	•	Afternoon: 2:30 p.m. – 8:00 p.m.
(Half-hour overlap)

We have 9 employees:
	•	Emily (full-time, sales)
	•	Jacob (full-time, cashier)
	•	Madison (part-time 75%, sales, student – only afternoon shifts)
	•	Samuel (full-time, inventory)
	•	Abigail (full-time, sales)
	•	Matthew (full-time, sales)
	•	Sofia (full-time, cashier)
	•	David (part-time 50%, sales and cashier)
	•	Victoria (full-time, cleaner)

Notes:
	•	Need at least one cashier and two salespeople on every shift.
	•	Madison is only available afternoons and weekends.
	•	Try to rotate weekend shifts fairly among all full-time employees.

Thanks a lot!
